# BLINKS  
**Tap-to-Pay & Scan-to-Pay Crypto Payments on Stellar**

BLINKS is a Stellar-native payment application that enables users to pay **directly with crypto** using **tap-to-pay (NFC)** or **scan-to-pay (QR)**, while merchants receive **instant USD settlement via Stellar Anchors**.

No Apple Pay.  
No Google Pay.  
No cards.  


Just crypto → payment → USD settlement.

---

## 🚨 Problem

Modern digital payments are controlled by closed, centralized platforms like Apple Pay and Google Pay. These systems:

- Require bank-issued cards and intermediaries  
- Exclude billions without reliable banking access  
- Lock merchants into proprietary ecosystems  
- Offer no native way to spend crypto  

Meanwhile, crypto users still cannot easily spend their assets in the real world without first cashing out.

**Crypto is global and instant — but spending it isn’t.**

---

## 💡 Solution

BLINKS removes Big Tech wallets entirely.

Users:
- Transfer crypto directly into the BLINKS app  
- Pay in-store or online using **tap** or **scan**  
- Settle payments directly on the Stellar blockchain  

Merchants:
- Price goods in USD  
- Accept crypto without volatility  
- Receive USD instantly via Stellar Anchors  
- Withdraw to local bank accounts  

BLINKS turns Stellar into a **global, open payment network**.

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

## 🔁 Payment Methods

### 1️⃣ Tap-to-Pay (NFC)
Best for fast, in-person retail.

**Flow**
1. Merchant enters amount in USD
2. POS emits NFC payment request
3. User taps phone
4. Transaction is signed and submitted to Stellar
5. Merchant receives USD instantly

---

### 2️⃣ Scan-to-Pay (QR)
Best for universal access and online commerce.

**Flow**
1. Merchant displays QR code
2. QR encodes payment details (amount, asset, memo)
3. User scans and confirms
4. Stellar transaction settles
5. Merchant USD balance updates instantly

Supports:
- Dynamic QR
- Static QR
- Deep links (SEP-0007 compatible)

---

## 💱 Asset & Settlement Model

### User Pays With
- XLM  
- Anchor-issued USD stablecoins  

### Merchant Receives
- USD via Stellar Anchors  

If user pays in XLM:
- Stellar path payments convert XLM → USD atomically
- Merchant is shielded from volatility

---

## 🏦 Stellar Anchors

BLINKS relies on Stellar Anchors for:
- Fiat custody
- Stablecoin issuance
- Compliance (KYB / AML)
- Bank off-ramps

### Initial Target Regions
- Nigeria (USD domiciliary accounts)
- Kenya (USD → MPesa Global)
- Ghana (USD bank payouts)
- South Africa (USD settlement rails)
- USA / EU (regulated anchors)

---

## 🔐 Security & Compliance

- Non-custodial wallet by default
- Encrypted key storage
- Biometric authentication
- Merchant KYB required
- User KYC risk-based
- AML monitoring via Anchors

---

## 📦 Tech Stack (Proposed)

- **Blockchain:** Stellar
- **Wallet:** Stellar SDK (JS / Mobile)
- **Payments:** Path Payments, SEP-7 URIs
- **Anchors:** SEP-6 / SEP-24 / SEP-31
- **Frontend:** React / React Native
- **Backend:** Node.js
